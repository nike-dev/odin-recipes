# odin-recipes

Introduction

This project intends to create a simple recipes website with three refined recipes for people with little time to browse
but want good food to eat. 

Objectives

The main objective of this project is to use the HTML learnings into practice and gain some necessary experience. Other 
objectives are: 
1. Practice writing broilerplate HTML.
2. Get familiar with links and images.
3. Use basic git add, commit and other git commands to get familiar with them.
4. Use display and box-sizing to change how elements behave in the webpage.
5. Write good commits and make of habit of it. (but obviously, I will get there someday xD)
6. Practice! Practice! Practice!
