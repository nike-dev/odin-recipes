                When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to All recipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea
                how
                successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up
                more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet
                for
                two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old — read all about his life and
                legacy here.
